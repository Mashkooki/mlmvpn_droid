/**
 * Where traffic actually leaves.
 *
 * This is the only statement about location in the whole panel that is evidence rather than a
 * label. `loc` is the country Cloudflare assigns the client it sees; `colo` is the edge
 * datacenter that answered; `warp` says whether the request arrived over Cloudflare's own
 * network.
 *
 * One caveat the UI must respect: when the path is WARP, `loc` reports the USER's country by
 * design, not the exit's -- a WARP session from Tehran reads `loc=IR colo=FRA` even though the
 * traffic really does leave in Frankfurt. So a WARP result is reported as "verified transit"
 * rather than "verified country", and [EgressResult.countryTrusted] is false, which is what
 * stops [QuickVerifiedStore] filing every node under Iran.
 *
 * Port of `traceEgress` in the desktop app's `quick-connect.js`.
