# Capture a focused logcat from the connected phone for MLM VPN debugging.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/grab-log.sh            # clear the buffer, then follow until Ctrl-C
#   ./scripts/grab-log.sh dump       # just dump what is already in the buffer
#
# Why a script: adb is installed under a WinGet package path with spaces in it, and the
# interesting lines are a handful of tags buried in a very chatty Samsung log. Filtering to
# the app's own PID keeps the core's own output (which is logged under generic tags) instead
# of losing it to a tag allow-list.
